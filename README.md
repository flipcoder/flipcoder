Hi, I'm Grady, known as flipcoder online.  I'm a coder and musician guy who sometimes blends these hobbies.

I write game engines, music/synthesizer software, and various code libraries and utilities.  Most of my open
source work is in C++ and Python.

Some of my open-source projects:
- [textbeat: a plaintext music sequencer](https://github.com/flipcoder/textbeat)
- [qork: a live-coding OpenGL game engine](https://github.com/flipcoder/qork) (work in progress!)
- [PyWeek29 Team Category Winner: "Butterfly Destroyers"](https://github.com/PythonixCoders/PyWeek29)
- [GitHub Game Jam 2016 Featured Game: "Hacking in Progress"](https://github.com/flipcoder/game-off-2016)
- [qor: my first big game engine](https://github.com/flipcoder/qor)
- [kit: C++ utility library used in Qor](https://github.com/flipcoder/kit)
- [fig: create GUI configuration dialogs using simple json](https://github.com/flipcoder/fig)

Therefore, any usage of my code in the Copilot Program outside of the stated licenses is unauthorized.  My repositories should be blacklisted from any neural network program that assumes contributors willingly consented to something that didn't exist back when they contributed.

Microsoft has admitted that about 0.1% of the code produced by Copilot is taken verbatim, i.e. stolen from projects of incompatible licenses.  Prior to Copilot's usage, people contributed through this site and others into projects with the assumption the code would not be stolen by Microsoft to power an AI.
