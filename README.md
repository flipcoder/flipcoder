Hi, I'm Grady O'Connell, known as flipcoder online.

I write game engines, music/synthesizer software, and various code libraries and utilities.  Most of my open
source work is in C++ and Python.

Some of my open-source projects:
- [textbeat: a plaintext music sequencer](https://github.com/flipcoder/textbeat)
- [qork: a live-coding OpenGL game engine](https://github.com/flipcoder/qork) (work in progress!)
